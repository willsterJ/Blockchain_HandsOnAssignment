v1.4.2 Release Notes - July 17, 2019
------------------------------------

What's New in Hyperledger Fabric CA v1.4.2
------------------------------------------

No new features.


Important Fixes
---------------
FABC-848 create table fails using Postgres with tls
Prior to the fix, when using Fabric CA with tls configured for Postres
database, the creation of the required tables fails upon initial
Fabric CA start.

FABC-837 Fabric CA panics when setup for multiple CAs
Prior to the fix, Fabric CA would panic upon start if configured
for multiple CAs (using --cafiles) and metric gathering.


Changes, Known Issues, and Workarounds
--------------------------------------

None.


Known Vulnerabilities
---------------------
FABC-174 Commands can be manipulated to delete identities or affiliations

This vulnerability can be resolved in one of two ways:

1) Use HTTPS (TLS) so that the authorization header is not in clear text.

2) The token generation/authentication mechanism was improved to optionally prevent
token reuse. In v1.4 a more secure token can be used by setting environment variable:

FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false

However, it cannot be set to false until all clients have
been updated to generate the more secure token and tolerate
FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false.
The Fabric CA client has been updated in v1.4 to generate the more secure token.
The Fabric SDKs will be updated by v2.0 timeframe to generate the more secure token,
at which time the default for Fabric CA server will change to:
FABRIC_CA_SERVER_COMPATIBILITY_MODE_V1_3=false

Resolved Vulnerabilities
------------------------
None.
